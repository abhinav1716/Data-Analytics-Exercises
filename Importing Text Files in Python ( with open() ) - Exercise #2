Importing Text Files in Python ( with open() ) - Exercise #2
You are provided with a text file named 'source.txt'. It's content has been stored in a variable named text.

Without removing the existing code in the *.py file, use the with open() syntax to perform the same operation, this time naming the file object out_file, which stands for 'output file'. 

Use the print() function twice: first, to check the content of the text variable, and then to see what has been stored in out_file.



filename='source.txt'
file = open(filename, mode = 'r')
text = file.read()
with open(filename,mode="r") as out_file:
    out_file.read()
print(text)
print(out_file)
