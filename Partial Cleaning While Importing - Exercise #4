Partial Cleaning While Importing - Exercise #4
Similar to the previous exercise, load only the first and last columns of the "Lending-Company-Total-Price-100.csv" file into a two-dimensional array named lending_co_TP, using a comma as the delimiter and skipping the first row. This time, however, use 32-bit NumPy float data types.

Display the contents of lending_co_TP to the console.



import numpy as np
lending_co_TP=np.genfromtxt("Lending-Company-Total-Price-100.csv",delimiter=",",skip_header=1,usecols=(0,-1),dtype=float)
print(lending_co_TP)
