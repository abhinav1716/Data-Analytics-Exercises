Importing Text Files in Python ( open() ) - Exercise #2
You are provided with a text file named 'source.txt'. Store the file's name in a variable called filename. Open the file, read its entire content into a variable, and then close it. Before and after closing the file, check if it is closed and display the status.

After confirming that the file is closed, display its content using the stored variable.



filename="source.txt"
file=open(filename,mode="r")
text=file.read()
print(file.closed)
file.close()
print(file.closed)
print(text)
