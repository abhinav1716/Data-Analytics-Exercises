Dimensions and the Squeeze Function - Exercise #2
1. Since array_3D[:1,0] may include one or more redundant dimensions, use the squeeze() function to reduce them.

2. Check the shape of the resulting array.



import numpy as np

array_3D = np.array([[[1,2,3,4,5], [11,21,31,41,51]], [[11,12,13,14,15], [51,52,53,54,5]]])

#1,
print(np.squeeze(array_3D[:1,0]))
#2.
print(np.squeeze(array_3D[:1,0]).shape)
