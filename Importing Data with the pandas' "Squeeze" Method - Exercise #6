Importing Data with the pandas' "Squeeze" Method - Exercise #6
You are provided with a CSV file named Customer-Gender-100.csv. It contains gender data for the first 100 customers of the lending company you worked with in previous coding exercises. This data has been loaded into an object named df_single_col.



Use the print() function to display the type of the df_single_col object.


import pandas as pd

df_single_col = pd.read_csv('Customer-Gender-100.csv')
print(type(df_single_col))
