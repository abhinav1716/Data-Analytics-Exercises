Creating DataFrames from Scratch - Exercise #1
Please be aware that in the next four exercises, we will require you to create a Pandas DataFrame in four different ways. There's no need to worry about assigning index values at this stage. Remember to use the print() function to display the desired output.

Use pandas to create the following DataFrame, and call it df:



import pandas as pd 
data={"Name":["Amy White","Jack Stewart","Richard Lauderdale","Sara Johnson"],"Age":[50,53,35,43],"Working Experience (Yrs.)":[5,8,3,10]}
df=pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
