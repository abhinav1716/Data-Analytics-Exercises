Data Selection - Indexing with .loc[] - Exercise #4
The pandas library has been imported with its conventional alias, and pandas display options relevant for full result visibility have been set.
The data from 'Sales-products-100.csv' has been loaded into an object called data, with 'SaleID' set as the index column. A copy of the DataFrame has been stored in a variable named sales_products_data.



Considering the data organization in sales_products_data, use a pandas label-based accessor to retrieve all available information for the 15th, 35th, and 97th sales recorded in the DataFrame.



import pandas as pd
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
pd.set_option('display.width', 2000)

data = pd.read_csv('Sales-products-100.csv', index_col = 'SaleID')
sales_products_data = data.copy()

print(sales_products_data.loc[["SaleID_15","SaleID_35","SaleID_97"]])
