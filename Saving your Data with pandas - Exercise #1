Saving your Data with pandas - Exercise #1
You are provided with a CSV file named 'Lending-company-100.csv'.



To begin, as a refresher, read the contents of the file into a DataFrame named my_data. Keep the code that has already been provided.

Use the print() function to display the first 5 rows of my_data.



import pandas as pd

filename = 'Lending-company-100.csv'
my_data = pd.read_csv(filename)
print(my_data.head())
