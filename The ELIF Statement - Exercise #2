The ELIF Statement - Exercise #2
Keep the first two conditions of the code from the previous exercise (if x > 200, print out "Big"; If x > 100 and x <= 200, print out "Average").

Add a new elif statement, so that, eventually, the program prints "Small" if x >= 0 and x <= 100, and "Negative" if x < 0.



x = 200

if x > 200: 
    print ("Big")
elif x > 100 and x <= 200:
    print ("Average")
elif x>=0 and x<=100:
    print("Small")
else:
    print("Negative")
