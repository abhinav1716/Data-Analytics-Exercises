String Accessors - Exercise #5
Check which of the names in last_names contain the letter s. If you've worked correctly, you should obtain a True value only for the first element of the last_names Series.


import pandas as pd
names = pd.Series(["Martin Peterson", "John Fitzpatrick", "Kate Cruz"])
last_names = names.str.split().str[1]
print(last_names.str.contains('s'))
