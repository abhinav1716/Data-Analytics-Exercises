Python String Methods - Exercise #2
Use the .replace() method to change the word "Administrative" with "Selling", thus making the variable s contain the string "Selling expenses".

s = 'Administrative expenses'
As you are doing that, store the output in a new variable called s1.

After assigning the value, print out the s1 variable.




s = 'Administrative expenses'
s1=s.replace('Administrative','Selling')
print(s1)
