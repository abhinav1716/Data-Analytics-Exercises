A Few Comments on Using .loc[] and .iloc[] - Exercise #3
The pandas library has been imported with its conventional alias, and pandas display options relevant for full result visibility have been set.
The data from 'Sales-products-100.csv' has been loaded into an object called data, with 'SaleID' set as the index column. A copy of the DataFrame has been stored in a variable named sales_products_data.



Consider that the 'Sales-products-100.csv' dataset contains data for 100 sales, all indexed as SaleID_1, SaleID_2, up to SaleID_100, sorted in increasing order (SaleID_1 appears first, SaleID_2 second, etc.) With that in mind, retrieve data for the 10th and 15th sales from the 'OrderMethod' column in the sales_products_data DataFrame.
Use a pandas label-based accessor to refer to the desired column, and a pandas integer-location based accessor to select the relevant rows.



import pandas as pd
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
pd.set_option('display.width', 2000)

data = pd.read_csv('Sales-products-100.csv', index_col = 'SaleID')
sales_products_data = data.copy()

print(sales_products_data.loc[:,'OrderMethod'].iloc[[9,14]])
