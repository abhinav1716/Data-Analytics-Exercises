The IF Statement - Exercise #2
Assign 10 to the variable x and 25 to the variable y. In the same cell, create 2 conditional statements. Let the first one print "Both conditions are correct" if x is greater then 3 and y is greater than 13. Let the second one print "At least one of the conditions is false" if x is less than or equal to 3 or y is less than or equal to 13. Change the values assigned to x and y and re-run the cell to verify your code still works.



x = 10
y = 25

# First conditional statement
if x > 3 and y > 13:
    print("Both conditions are correct")

# Second conditional statement
if x <= 3 or y <= 13:
    print("At least one of the conditions is false")
