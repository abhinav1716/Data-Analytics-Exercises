A Few Comments on Using .loc[] and .iloc[] - Exercise #5
The pandas library has been imported with its conventional alias, and pandas display options relevant for full result visibility have been set.
The data from 'Sales-products-100.csv' has been loaded into an object called data, with 'SaleID' set as the index column. A copy of the DataFrame has been stored in a variable named sales_products_data.



Using a pandas label-based accessor, retrieve all data for the 50th and 87th sales.



import pandas as pd
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
pd.set_option('display.width', 2000)

data = pd.read_csv('Sales-products-100.csv', index_col='SaleID')
sales_products_data = data.copy()

print(sales_products_data.loc[["SaleID_50","SaleID_87"]])
