Conditional Statements, Functions, and Loops - Exercise #1
You are provided with the nums list. Define a function called count() containing a while loop to count the number of values in the nums list that are lower than 20.


nums = [1,35,12,24,31,51,70,100]
def count(numbers):
    total=0
    i=0
    while i<len(numbers):
        if numbers[i]<20:
            total+=1 
        i+=1
    return total
count(nums)
