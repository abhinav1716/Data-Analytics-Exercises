Dimensions and the Squeeze Function - Exercise #1
Use conditional slicing and indexing to access the first row of the first 2D array inside array_3D, and examine the shape of the resulting selections:

1.A
Access the first row of the first 2D array in array_3D using exact indices for both dimensions.
1.B
Check the shape of the resulting object.
2.A
Access the first row of the first 2D array in array_3D using a slice for the first dimension and an exact index for the second dimension.
2.B
Check the shape of the resulting object.
3.A
Access the first row of the first 2D array in array_3D using slices for both dimensions (from the start up to index 1).
3.B
Check the shape of the obtained object.




import numpy as np

array_3D = np.array([[[1,2,3,4,5], [11,21,31,41,51]], [[11,12,13,14,15], [51,52,53,54,5]]])

#1.A
print(array_3D[0, 0])
#1.B
print(array_3D[0, 0].shape)
 
#2.A
print(array_3D[:1, 0])
#2.B
print(array_3D[:1, 0].shape)
 
#3.A
print(array_3D[:1, :1])
#3.B
print(array_3D[:1, :1].shape)
