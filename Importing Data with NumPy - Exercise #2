Importing Data with NumPy - Exercise #2
Use the NumPy function np.genfromtxt() to load the "Lending-Company-Total-Price-100.csv" file and display its contents. To solve the task, specify a comma as the delimiter in the function call.



Note: Please remember what the following line of code does — it configures NumPy's print settings to improve output readability:

np.set_printoptions(suppress = True, linewidth = 150)

suppress=True prevents small floating-point numbers from being displayed in scientific notation.

linewidth=150 increases the number of characters per line before wrapping, helping to display more of the array on a single line.



import numpy as np

np.set_printoptions(suppress = True, linewidth = 150)

lending_co_TP = np.genfromtxt("Lending-Company-Total-Price-100.csv",delimiter=',')

print(lending_co_TP)
