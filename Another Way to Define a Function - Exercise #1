Another Way to Define a Function - Exercise #1
Define a function called exponentiation_exp_2(x) that states the value of the argument accompanied by the phrase "Raised to the power of 2:" and returns a value equal to its argument raised to the power of 2. This time, use a new variable, called result, in the body of the Function. Call the function with some argument to verify it works properly.

def exponentiation_exp_2(x):
    res=x**2 
    print("Raised to the power of 2:")
    return res 
exponentiation_exp_2(3)
