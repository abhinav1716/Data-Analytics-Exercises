NumPy Basics - Exercise #3
The NumPy library has been imported using the conventional alias, and the two-dimensional array array_2 has been created using two lists. Its column-wise mean has been computed and displayed.

Now, modify the last line of code to ensure that all values are returned as integers.

Execute the code to compare the results between the two calculations of the column-wise mean of array_2.


import numpy as np
array_2 = np.array([[4,5],[7,10]])

# Compute and display the column-wise mean of array_2
print(np.mean(array_2, axis = 0))

# Compute the column-wise mean and cast the result to integer
print(np.mean(array_2, axis = 0,dtype=int))
