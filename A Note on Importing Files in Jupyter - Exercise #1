A Note on Importing Files in Jupyter - Exercise #1
Python provides an operating-system-neutral way to obtain the path of the current working directory.

Complete the code on line 8, and then use the print() function to display the contents of the os_dir variable (which stands for Operating System Directory) - this will give you the path to the directory you are currently working in.


import os, inspect

if '__file__' not in locals():
    fx = inspect.getframeinfo(inspect.currentframe())[0]
else:
    fx = __file__  
    
os_dir =os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(fx)) 

print(os_dir)
