Saving Your Data with NumPy - np.savez() - Exercise #1
Store the data from lending_co_saving and lending_co_total_price as separate  named saving and total_price, respectively, in a *.npz file named "Saving-Exercise-3".



Note: In this exercise, the focus is not on the contents of the files. So, you don't need to check the data stored in any of them.

import numpy as np
np.set_printoptions(suppress = True, linewidth = 150)

lending_co_saving = np.genfromtxt("Lending-Company-Saving-100.csv", 
                                    delimiter = ',', 
                                    dtype = str)

lending_co_total_price = np.genfromtxt("Lending-Company-Total-Price-100.csv", 
                                    delimiter = ',', 
                                    dtype = str)
                                    
np.savez("Saving-Exercise-3",saving=lending_co_saving,total_price=lending_co_total_price)
