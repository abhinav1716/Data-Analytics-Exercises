Importing Text Files in Python ( with open() ) - Exercise #1
You are provided with a text file named 'source.txt'. Store the file's name in a variable called filename. Use another variable, file, to open the file, read its entire content into a variable, and then close it. Store the content of the file in a third variable called text.

Use only the open() function to solve the exercise (i.e. do not use the with keyword).



filename="source.txt"
file=open(filename,mode="r")
text=file.read() 
file.close()
print(file.closed)
