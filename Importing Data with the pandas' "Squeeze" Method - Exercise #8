Importing Data with the pandas' "Squeeze" Method - Exercise #8
You are provided with a CSV file named 'Lending-company-100.csv'. This data has been loaded into a variable named data, and then squeezed into another variable named df_squeeze.

Use the print() function to verify that df_squeeze is indeed a DataFrame.


import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv('Lending-company-100.csv')
df_squeeze = data.squeeze("columns")
print(type(df_squeeze))
