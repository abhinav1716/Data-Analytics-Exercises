Importing *.json Files - Exercise #8
You are provided with a JSON file named 'Lending-company-100.json'.

Read its contents into a DataFrame using the pandas library and assign it to a variable named new_csv_data.

Use the print() function to display the entire contents of the DataFrame.


import pandas as pd
new_csv_data=pd.read_json('Lending-company-100.json')
print(new_csv_data)
