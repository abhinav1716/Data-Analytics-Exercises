Importing *.json Files - Exercise #7
You are provided with a JSON file named 'Lending-company-100.json'.


Read its contents into a DataFrame using the pandas library.

Use the print() function to display the entire contents of the DataFrame.

Try to solve this exercise by providing a single line of code (and without creating a new variable).



import pandas as pd
print(pd.read_json('Lending-company-100.json'))
