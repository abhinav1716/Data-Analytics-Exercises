Importing Text Files in Python ( with open() ) - Exercise #4
You are provided with a text file named 'source.txt', containing the following text:

This is the simplest plain text file!

The existing code is supposed to be used to open the file in 'write' mode and replace its content with the string "It is not so simple anymore!".

Now, use a variable named file to open the file again. Read its content and store its data into a separate variable named text, then close the file.

Print the content of the text variable to confirm that it has been updated.



filename='source.txt'

with open(filename, mode = 'w') as out_file:
    out_file.write("It is not so simple anymore!")
file=open(filename,'r')
text=file.read()
file.close()
print(text)
