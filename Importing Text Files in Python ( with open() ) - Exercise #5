Importing Text Files in Python ( with open() ) - Exercise #5
You are provided with a text file named 'source.txt', containing the following text:

This is the simplest plain text file!

The existing code is supposed to be used to open the file in 'write' mode and replace its content with the string "It is not so simple anymore!".

Now, use another with open() syntax to read the contents of the file (using the new file object) into a variable named new_text.

Print the content of the new_text variable to confirm that it has been updated.




filename='source.txt'

with open(filename, mode = 'w') as out_file:
    out_file.write("It is not so simple anymore!")
with open(filename,'r') as out_file:
    new_text=out_file.read()
print(new_text)
