Data Selection in pandas DataFrames - Exercise #9
The pandas library has been imported with its conventional alias, and pandas display options relevant for full result visibility have been set.
The data from 'Sales-products-100.csv' has been loaded into an object called data, and a copy of it has been stored in a variable named sales_products_data.



As shown in the picture, retrieve the top five rows from the "Revenue" and "Quantity" columns from sales_products_data. Use one line of code to solve the exercise.



import pandas as pd
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
pd.set_option('display.width', 2000)

data = pd.read_csv('Sales-products-100.csv')
sales_products_data = data.copy()

print(sales_products_data[["Revenue","Quantity"]].head())
