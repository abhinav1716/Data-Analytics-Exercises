Saving Your Data with NumPy - np.save() - Exercise #1
Store the data from lending_co_saving and lending_co_total_price in separate *.npy files named "Saving-Exercise-1" and "Saving-Exercise-2", respectively.



Note: In this exercise, the focus is not on the contents of the files. So, you don't need to check the data stored in any of them.


import numpy as np
np.set_printoptions(suppress = True, linewidth = 150)

lending_co_saving = np.genfromtxt("Lending-Company-Saving-100.csv", 
                                    delimiter = ',', 
                                    dtype = np.str)

lending_co_total_price = np.genfromtxt("Lending-Company-Total-Price-100.csv",
                                    delimiter = ',', 
                                    dtype = np.str)
np.save("Saving-Exercise-1",lending_co_saving)
np.save("Saving-Exercise-2",lending_co_total_price)
