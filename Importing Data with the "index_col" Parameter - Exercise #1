Importing Data with the "index_col" Parameter - Exercise #1
You are provided with a CSV file named 'Lending-company-100.csv'.

1. Load its entire content into a DataFrame named my_csv_data, ensuring that the filename is used directly in the pd.read_csv() function rather than being stored in a separate variable.

2. Finally, display the full content of the DataFrame using the print() function.



import pandas as pd
my_csv_data=pd.read_csv("Lending-company-100.csv")
print(my_csv_data)
