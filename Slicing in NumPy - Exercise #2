Slicing in NumPy - Exercise #2
Consider the provided 3D array and supply arguments to the print() functions to complete the following tasks:

1. Slice the first column of both matrices in the 3D array.

2. Slice every other column of both matrices in the 3D array.




import numpy as np

array_3D = np.array([[[1,2,3,4,5], [11,21,31,41,51]], [[11,12,13,14,15], [51,52,53,54,5]]])

#1.
print(array_3D[:,:,0])
#2.
print(array_3D[:,:,::2])
