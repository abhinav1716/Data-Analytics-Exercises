Importing Data with the pandas' "Squeeze" Method - Exercise #14
You are provided with a CSV file named 'Customer-Gender-100.csv'. It contains gender data for the first 100 customers of the lending company you worked with in previous coding exercises. After loading the contents of the file into an object named df_single_col, its data has been squeezed into a variable named selected_data.

Use the print() function to display the type of the selected_data object.


import pandas as pd

df_single_col = pd.read_csv('Customer-Gender-100.csv')
selected_data = df_single_col.squeeze("columns")
print(type(selected_data))
