Importing Data with the pandas' "Squeeze" Method - Exercise #13
You are provided with a CSV file named 'Customer-Gender-100.csv'. It contains gender data for the first 100 customers of the lending company you worked with in previous coding exercises.

1. Load the contents of the file into an object named df_single_col.

2. Squeeze the data from df_single_col into a new variable named selected_data.

3. Use the print() function to display the first 5 rows of selected_data.


import pandas as pd 

df_single_col = pd.read_csv("Customer-Gender-100.csv")
selected_data=df_single_col.squeeze("columns")
print(selected_data.head())
