car_brand = ['Audi', 'Ford']
number_of_cars_for_sale = [1000, 1200]
price_of_model = 37500.50

print ("The \"%s\" shop are expecting to sell %d units of the new %s model next year." % (car_shop[0], number_of_cars_for_sale[0], car_brand[0]) + 
       " \tThe \"%s\" shop are expecting to sell %d units of the new %s model next year." % (car_shop[1], number_of_cars_for_sale[1], car_brand[1]))
