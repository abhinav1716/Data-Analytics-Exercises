Data Selection - Indexing with .iloc[] - Exercise #8
The pandas library has been imported with its conventional alias, and pandas display options relevant for full result visibility have been set.
The data from 'Sales-products-100.csv' has been loaded into an object called data, and a copy of it has been stored in a variable named sales_products_data.



Prove that .iloc[] can be used with a Series, not just a DataFrame. To do this, retrieve the first element from the 'Product' column in sales_products_data.

import pandas as pd
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
pd.set_option('display.width', 2000)

data = pd.read_csv('Sales-products-100.csv')
sales_products_data = data.copy()

print(sales_products_data['Product'].iloc[0])
