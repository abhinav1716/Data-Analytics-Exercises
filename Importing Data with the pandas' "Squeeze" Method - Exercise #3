Importing Data with the pandas' "Squeeze" Method - Exercise #3
You are provided with a CSV file named 'Lending-company-100.csv'.

Read only the 'Product' column from the file into an object named df_usecols. Then, use the print() function to display the first 5 rows of the extracted column.


import pandas as pd
df_usecols=pd.read_csv("Lending-company-100.csv",usecols=["Product"])
print(df_usecols.head())
