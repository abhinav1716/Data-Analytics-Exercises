Creating DataFrames from Scratch - Exercise #2
There's no need to worry about assigning index values at this stage. Please remember to use the print() function to display the desired output.

Use pandas to create the following DataFrame, and call it df:



import pandas as pd 
data=[{"Name":"Amy White","Age":50,"Working Experience (Yrs.)":5},
        {"Name":"Jack Stewart","Age":53,"Working Experience (Yrs.)":8},
        {"Name":"Richard Lauderdale","Age":35,"Working Experience (Yrs.)":3},{"Name":"Sara Johnson","Age":43,"Working Experience (Yrs.)":10}]
df=pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
