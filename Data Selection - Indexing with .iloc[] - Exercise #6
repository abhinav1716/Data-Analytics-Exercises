Data Selection - Indexing with .iloc[] - Exercise #6
The pandas library has been imported with its conventional alias, and pandas display options relevant for full result visibility have been set.
The data from 'Sales-products-100.csv' has been loaded into an object called data, and a copy of it has been stored in a variable named sales_products_data.\



If you successfully completed the previous exercise using the .shape attribute, you should have obtained the following output: (100, 12)

This means there are 100 rows and 12 columns in the sales_products_data DataFrame.

Now, use the .iloc[] accessor to retrieve the value stored in the rightmost column of the last row.



import pandas as pd
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
pd.set_option('display.width', 2000)

data = pd.read_csv('Sales-products-100.csv')
sales_products_data = data.copy()

print(sales_products_data.iloc[99,11])
