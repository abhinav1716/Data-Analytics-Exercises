Using the .format() Method - Exercise #4
Obtain the following output:

"Company A expects their next year's sales of Q3 to increase."
while referring to the following three lists:

companies = ['Company A', 'Company B']
quarter = [1, 2, 3, 4]
sales_performance_prediction = ['increase', 'decrease', 'remain the same']
Help yourself with using appropriate indexing.



companies = ['Company A', 'Company B']
quarter = [1, 2, 3, 4]
sales_performance_prediction = ['increase', 'decrease', 'remain the same']
print("{} expects their next year's sales of Q{} to {}.".format(companies[0],quarter[2],sales_performance_prediction[0]))
