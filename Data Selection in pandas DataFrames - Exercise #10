Data Selection in pandas DataFrames - Exercise #10
The pandas library has been imported with its conventional alias, and pandas display options relevant for full result visibility have been set.
The data from 'Sales-products-100.csv' has been loaded into an object called data, and a copy of it has been stored in a variable named sales_products_data.



As shown in the picture, retrieve the top five rows from the "Revenue" and "Quantity" columns from sales_products_data. To solve the exercise, include the column_names object in your one line of code.




import pandas as pd
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
pd.set_option('display.width', 2000)

data = pd.read_csv('Sales-products-100.csv')
sales_products_data = data.copy()

column_names = ['Revenue', 'Quantity']

print(sales_products_data[column_names].head())
