Importing *.csv Files with pandas - Exercise #1
You are provided with a text file named 'Lending-company-100. csv'.

Use a variable named filename to store the file's name.

Open the file using the open() function and store its entire content into a variable called file.

Read the content of the text variable into a separate variable called text.

To conclude, print the type of the type of the text variable to confirm that it has been updated.



filename="Lending-company-100.csv"
file=open(filename,mode='r')
text=file.read()

print(type(text))
