Common Attributes for Working with DataFrames - Exercise #6
The pandas library has been imported with its conventional alias, and pandas display options relevant for full result visibility have been set.
The data from 'Sales-products-100.csv' has been loaded into an object called data, and a copy of it has been stored in a variable named sales_products_data.
New column names have also been provided and applied to create a new DataFrame called df, which contains the same data as sales_products_data.



Use pandas’ .axes attribute to compare the column labels of df and sales_products_data, in this order.




import pandas as pd
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
pd.set_option('display.width', 2000)

data = pd.read_csv('Sales-products-100.csv')
sales_products_data = data.copy()

new_column_names = ['SaleID', 'Country', 'OrderMethod', 'Retailer', 'Line', 'Type', 'Product', 'YearOfSales', 'Quarter', 'Revenue','Quantity', 'Margin']

df = pd.DataFrame(sales_products_data, columns = new_column_names)

print(df.axes)
print(sales_products_data.axes)
