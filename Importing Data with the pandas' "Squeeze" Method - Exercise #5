Importing Data with the pandas' "Squeeze" Method - Exercise #5
You are provided with a CSV file named 'Customer-Gender-100.csv'. It contains gender data for the first 100 customers of the lending company you worked with in previous coding exercises.

Load the contents of the file into an object named df_single_col.

Use the print() function to display the first 5 rows of that object.


import pandas as pd
df_single_col=pd.read_csv("Customer-Gender-100.csv")
print(df_single_col.head())
