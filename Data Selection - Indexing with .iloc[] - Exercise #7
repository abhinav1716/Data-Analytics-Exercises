Data Selection - Indexing with .iloc[] - Exercise #7
The pandas library has been imported with its conventional alias, and pandas display options relevant for full result visibility have been set.
The data from 'Sales-products-100.csv' has been loaded into an object called data, and a copy of it has been stored in a variable named sales_products_data.\



If you successfully completed the previous exercise using the .iloc accessor, you should have obtained the following output: 0.34681016.

Now, to verify your result, apply the .tail() method to the sales_products_data DataFrame and observe the last value in the rightmost column.



import pandas as pd
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
pd.set_option('display.width', 2000)

data = pd.read_csv('Sales-products-100.csv')
sales_products_data = data.copy()

print(sales_products_data.tail())
