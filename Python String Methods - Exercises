Python String Methods - Exercise #3
Check if the string s currently starts with "Admin"


s = 'Administrative expenses'
print(s.startswith('Admin'))



Python String Methods - Exercise #4
Verify that the string stored in s1 now starts with "Sell".



s = 'Administrative expenses'
s1 = s.replace('Administrative', 'Selling')
print(s1.startswith('Sell'))



Python String Methods - Exercise #5
Will you receive a 'False' output if you verify that the string stored in s1 now starts with "sell' instead of "Sell'?



s = 'Administrative expenses'
s1 = s.replace('Administrative', 'Selling')
print(s1.startswith('sell'))




Python String Methods - Exercise #6
Does the expression in s1 end at "diture"?


s = 'Administrative expenses'
s1 = s.replace('Administrative', 'Selling')
print(s1.endswith('diture'))



Python String Methods - Exercise #7
Verify that the string in s1 actually ends with 'ses'.

s = 'Administrative expenses'
s1 = s.replace('Administrative', 'Selling')
print(s1.endswith('ses'))



Python String Methods - Exercise #8
Use a Python method without passing any arguments into it to return a list containing the words from s1 as its elements.


s = 'Administrative expenses'
s1 = s.replace('Administrative', 'Selling')
print(s1.split())



Python String Methods - Exercise #9
Generate the same output that you would get from using the split() method, but this time, pass an argument within the parentheses of the method.


s = 'Administrative expenses'
s1 = s.replace('Administrative', 'Selling')
print(s1.split(' '))



Python String Methods - Exercise #10
Split the s1 string by the letter 's' to explore a list with what elements you will obtain.


s = 'Administrative expenses'
s1 = s.replace('Administrative', 'Selling')
print(s1.split('s'))



Python String Methods - Exercise #11
Create and print out a string called s2 containing the following text:

'personal ID, first name, last name, date of birth, place of birth, city of birth'.


s2='personal ID, first name, last name, date of birth, place of birth, city of birth'
print(s2)



Python String Methods - Exercise #12
Use a Python's method to split the text of s2 into different elements as separated by the comma symbol.


s2 = "personal ID, first name, last name, date of birth, place of birth, city of birth"
print(s2.split(','))


Python String Methods - Exercise #13
How many characters are there in the s2 string currently?


s2 = "personal ID, first name, last name, date of birth, place of birth, city of birth"
print(len(s2))



Python String Methods - Exercise #14
Store the list obtained after splitting the elements from s2 in a variable called list_01, and then print its output.


s2 = "personal ID, first name, last name, date of birth, place of birth, city of birth"
list_01=s2.split(',')
print(list_01)


Python String Methods - Exercise #15
How many elements are there in the list_01 list currently?


s2 = "personal ID, first name, last name, date of birth, place of birth, city of birth"
list_01 = s2.split(',')
print(len(list_01))



Python String Methods - Exercise #16
Use a Python method to convert all the letters in the string s to lowercase and display the result.

s = 'Administrative expenses'
print(s.lower())


Python String Methods - Exercise #17
Use a Python method to convert all the letters in the string s to uppercase and display the result.

s = 'Administrative expenses'
print(s.upper())



Python String Methods - Exercise #18
Apply a Python method that will return the first letter of each word of s as uppercase, while the rest of the letters remain lowercase.

s = 'Administrative expenses'
print(s.title())


Python String Methods - Exercise #19
Create and visualize a string named name1 that contains the text:

'Martin Peterson   '.

Please note that there are three trailing spaces at the end of the string that should not be ignored.

name1='Martin Peterson   '
print(name1)



Python String Methods - Exercise #20
Use a Python string method to remove the whitespaces at the right end of the string.

name1 = 'Martin Peterson   '
print(name1.strip())
