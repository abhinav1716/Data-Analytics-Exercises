Types of Data Supported by NumPy - Exercise #1
Before execution, add or modify the given code so that:

array_1D is composed of strings, and

array_2D is composed of 32-bit floats.

Use the same data values as in the original arrays.



import numpy as np

array_1D = np.array([10,11,12,13,14],dtype=str)
array_2D = np.array([[20,30,40,50,60], [43,54,65,76,87], [11,22,33,44,55]],dtype=np.float32)
