Iterating over Dictionaries - Exercise #1
In this exercise you will use the same dictionaries as the ones we used in the lesson - prices and quantity. This time, don't just calculate all the money Jan spent. Calculate how much she spent on products with a price of 5 dollars or more.



prices = {
    "box_of_spaghetti" : 4,
    "lasagna"  : 5,
    "hamburger" : 2
   }
quantity = {
    "box_of_spaghetti" : 6,
    "lasagna"  : 10,
    "hamburger" : 0
    }

money_spent = 0
for i in prices:
    if prices[i]>=5:
        money_spent=money_spent+(prices[i]*quantity[i])
    else:
        money_spent=money_spent
print(money_spent)
