Partial Cleaning While Importing - Exercise #3
Load only the first and last columns of the "Lending-Company-Total-Price-100.csv" file into a two-dimensional array named lending_co_TP, using a comma as the delimiter, a string data type, and skipping the first row.

Display the contents of lending_co_TP to the console.


import numpy as np
lending_co_TP=np.genfromtxt("Lending-Company-Total-Price-100.csv",delimiter=",",dtype=str,skip_header=1,usecols=(0,-1))
print(lending_co_TP)
