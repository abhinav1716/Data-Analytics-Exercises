pow(10,3)



Notable Built-In Functions in Python - Exercise #8
In one line of code, find how many characters there are in the word "Elephant"?

len("Elephant")



Notable Built-In Functions in Python - Exercise #9
Create a function, called distance_from_zero(), that returns the absolute value of a provided single argument and prints a statement "Not possible" if the argument provided is not a number. To solve the task, use the type() function in the body of distance_from_zero().

Call the function with the values of -10 and "cat" to verify it works correctly.



def distance_from_zero(a):
    typ=type(a)
    if typ==str:
        print("Not possible")
    else:
        return abs(a)
distance_from_zero(-10)
